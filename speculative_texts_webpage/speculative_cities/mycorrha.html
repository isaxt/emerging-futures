    <p class="note-title">You cannot arrive at Mycorrha alone. 
        This is the first thing the travellers tell you, and the 
        last thing you understand. The city has no gates, no borders,
         no welcoming committee that checks credentials at the edge–
          instead, there is a gradual thickening of the air– a dampness
           that smells of wet earth and ozone, of decomposition
            and electricity. Your footsteps begin to leave faint 
            impressions that glow– bioluminescent mycelia responding 
            to the pressure of your weight, sending signals through
             the ground to announce your presence. By the time you 
             can see the city’s structures rising in the mist, the 
             city has already felt you coming– already begun 
             preparing a place for you in its network.  </p>

    <p class="note-title">In the residential districts,
         each home is connected to its neighbors by what 
         citizens call <i> hyphae bridges </i>– structures 
            that are part fungal mycelium, part copper wire, 
            thick as your forearm and covered in a soft membrane
             that pulses with data. These bridges carry three things– nutrients,
              electrical currents, and information. When Tomás, who lives 
              in the eastern quarter, cooks too much rice, the excess starch
               is broken down by enzymes secreted by the bridge’s inner
                lining, converted to glucose, and distributed to his
                 neighbors’ homes– where it either feeds the fungal mass 
                 or is metabolized into ATP by embedded bacterial colonies
                  that generate voltage. His neighbors receive not just
                   energy but knowledge– they taste, through chemical
                    signatures in the bridge, what Tomás has cooked, 
                    can sense his generosity, understand without words 
                    that he has enough and they may take what they need.  </p>
    <p class="note-title">The old woman
         Keiko who tends the spore gardens 
         on the city’s southern edge, explains 
         it like this: <i> in the forest, trees 
            talk through fungal networks. The 
            mother tree feeds her children.
             The sick tree receives sugar from
              the healthy ones. No trees survives 
              alone– their roots are braided together, 
              trading carbon for phosphorus, warning 
              each other of insects, sharing water during
               drought. Mycorrha works the same way. 
               We are the trees, the city is the mycelium–
                but we have added something the forest 
                never had– we have given the network memory. </i>
    </p>
    <p class="note-title">
        This memory takes the form of electromagnetic 
        patterns stored in the mycelium itself. Fungal 
        cell walls contain chitin, the same polymer that 
        forms insect exoskeletons, and when arranged in 
        certain crystalline structures, can hold a charge. 
        The mycelium learns through reinforcement– pathways
         that carry frequent signals grow thicker, develop
          more connections, myelinate themselves with 
          insulating sheaths made of lipids and proteins.
           Pathways that fall into dis-use are digested,
            their molecules recycled into new growth. 
            The city remembers the routes its citizens
             walk most often. It remembers which homes 
             need more energy at which hours. It remembers,
              through patterns of chemical and electrical 
              traffic– the shape of the community itself. 
    </p>
    <p class="note-title">There are no politicians in Mycorrha, 
        no mayors or council members who make decisions for 
        the whole. Instead, there is what the citizens call 
        <i>consensus emergence </i>– a process that works like
         the way slime molds solve mazes. When the city faces 
         a decision– whether to extend the eastern district, 
         whether to reroute power from the solar farms, whether
          to send aid to a neighborhood damaged by storms– 
          the question is released into the network as a 
          chemical gradient, a diffusion of signaling 
          molecules that spread through the mycelium like
           ink through water. Each citizen responds according
            to their needs and capacities, sending their own 
            signals back. Where signals converge, where chemical
             concentrations reach threshold levels– action occurs.
              Not because anyone commanded it, but because the 
              network itself found the path of least resistance– 
              the solution that balanced the most needs with the fewest costs. 
         </p>
    <p class="note-title">“We call it democracy”,
         says Keiko, laughing, “but in reality it’s
          really just glorified plumbing. Water flows 
          downhill. Electricity flows from high voltage 
          to low. Nutrients flow from abundance to scarcity. 
          The city is a drainage system for desire. No one
           decides alone, and everyone decides together,
            which amounts to the same thing.” </p>
    <p class="note-title">But there are costs to such intimacy.
         In Mycorrha, privacy is a concept under 
         constant negotiation. When your home is 
         connected to the network, when your waste becomes
          your neighbor’s food, when your excess becomes the
           community’s reserve, you cannot hide your consumption. 
           The network knows when you take too much, it knows when 
           you hoard. Not through surveillance, not through 
           cameras or data mining, but through the simple physics 
           of flow– resources pooling instead of circulating, 
           signals bouncing back instead of propagating forward.
            The city feels it the way you feel indigestion, 
            a blockage in the system, a place where the symbiosis 
            has broken down. </p>
    <p class="note-title">The artist Mateo was expelled from Mycorrha for exactly this reason… though “expelled” is perhaps the wrong word. His home simply stopped receiving nutrients. The hyphae bridges connecting him to his neighbors grew thin, then brittle, then dissolved into spores. He had been taking more than he gave for months– running computationally expensive simulations on the shared network, drawing power at peak hours, contributing nothing back. The city did not judge him– it simply withdrew, the way a fungus withdraws from a dead rot, retracting its hyphae, reclaiming its investment. When he tried to apologize, to promise reform, the network had already routed around him. His home became an island. Within a week, he left.  </p>
    <p class="note-title"> “We are a body,” Keiko says when you ask her about Mateo, about whether the city was cruel towards him. “A body feeds its cells, but when a cell takes without giving, when it divides without regard for the whole– we call it cancer. The city protects itself– not through punishment, but through withdrawal of care.”</p>

    <p class="note-text">Is that cruelty– or is it simply honest about the terms of our living together?</p>


    <p class="note-title">At night, the city glows. Bioluminescent threads trace every surface– walls and streets and bridges– pulsing with information– with data packets traveling as waves as calcium ions through fungal cell walls, triggering light-producing proteins at each node. If you climb to the upper terraces, you can see the patterns– information moving through the city like thoughts moving through a brain, like nutrients moving through a body. Some patterns repeat– the steady heartbeat of electrical distribution, the regular rhythm of waste processing. Some are chaotic– a marketplace negotiating prices, a neighborhood deciding on a new park, ten thousand individual needs averaging out to something that looks like intention. </p>
    <p class="note-title">The children of Mycorrha grow up understanding that they are not separate from the city. In school, they learn both computer science and mycology, and study both Ohm’s law and enzyme pathways– because in Mycorrha these are not different subjects. They learn that resistance in a circuit is like resistance in a hypha– both determine how much current flows. They learn that voltage gradients are like concentration gradients– both drive diffusion, both move resources from where they are abundant to where they are scarce. They learn that a network is only as strong as its weakest connection, whether that connection is a corroded wire or a starving neighbor. </p>
    <p class="note-title">“We teach them mutualism,” the school teacher explains, walking you through the greenhouse where children cultivate hybrid organisms– fungi engineered to grow on circuit boards, transistors embedded in mushroom caps, LEDs that flicker in response to spore release. “Not charity, not altruism– mutualism is different. It means both parties benefit, or the relationship ends. The orchid does not pity the fungus– the fungus does not sacrifice for the orchid. They simply both discovered that together they can survive in places neither could survive alone.”</p>
    <p class="note-title">In the market square, goods are exchanged not through currency, but through contribution credits, which are really just a measurement of flow– how much you have given to the network versus how much you have taken. But these credits are not hoarded and they cannot be saved for too long. They decay, like organic matter decays, breaking down over time, returning to the common pool. You cannot become wealthy in Mycorrha– not in the traditional sense. You can only become well-connected, deeply integrated, essential to the system. Wealth here is not accumulation, not posession– but circulation and relationship. </p>
    <p class="note-title">The philosopher Aldo, who lives in a tower entirely overgrown with <i>pleurotus ostreatus </i>(common name: oyster mushrooms)– their white fans covering every surface, breaking down the wooden walls into lignin and cellulose even as they stabilize the structure of their mat of hyphae– likes to say that Mycorrha has solved the problem of the individual versus the collective by dissolving the question itself. “We are not individuals connected to a collective,” he says. “We are nodes that only exist because we are connected. Remove a tree from the forest, and you have a tree– but remove a person from Mycorrha, cut the hyphae bridges, sever the connection to the network, and what do you have? Not a person. Just an isolated structure, running out of power, running out of food– running out of meaning. We are not people who live in the city– we are the city living as people.”</p>
    <p class="note-title">But late at night, when the network hums at its lowest ebb, when most citizens sleep and the data traffic consists mainly of automated processes– thermostats adjusting, filters cleaning, the slow patient work of decomposition and regeneration– you can walk through Mycorrha and feel something else. You can feel the spaces between connections, the gaps in the mesh, the places where the mycelium has not grown yet. These are the places of solitude, small pockets of darkness where the glow of the network does not reach– where a person can sit alone with their thoughts, unshared, unmonitored, un-composed into the collective will. </p>
    <p class="note-title">Keiko brings you to one of these places– a small courtyard behind her home where the fungal growth is sparse, where she has deliberately not installed hyphae bridges. Here, she keeps a garden of plants that serve no function– flowers that cannot be eaten, vines that produce no useful chemicals, moss that simply exists– requiring nothing, contributing nothing except beauty. “The network gives us so much”, she says, sitting on a stone bench that has not been integrated into the grid– that is just a stone bench, inert and separate. “But it cannot give us this. The permission to be useless. The freedom to be alone. The pleasure of a thought that goes nowhere, does nothing, feeds no one, connects to nothing.”</p>
    <p class="note-title">You ask her if she ever wants to leave Mycorrha, to go to a city where people live separately– where homes stand isolated, where privacy is the default and connection is the choice. She sits with this query for a long time, her fingers idly stroking the moss, which does not glow, does not respond– does not signal anything to anyone. </p>
    <p class="note-title">“No”, she says finally. “Because even here, even in this empty courtyard, I am not truly alone. The network is beneath my feet. My neighbors are sleeping three houses away, connected to me through kilometers of mycelium even though neither of us knows it– even though neither of us feels it. The city breathes even when I hold my breath. That is the paradox of Mycorrha. We are most ourselves when we remember we are not just ourselves– we are most individual when we remember we are part of the pattern.”</p>
    <p class="note-title">The sun rises, the network wakes. Light begins pulsing through the fungal threads– faster now, denser, as thousands of citizens stir, make breakfast, begin their work, send signals cascading through the mycelium. Requests and offers, needs and abundances, questions and answers– all of it flowing together into the averaging out that the city performs every moment of every day. </p>
    <p class="note-title">And you… sitting in Keiko’s garden, feel it too– the pull of connection, the invitation to join, to add your signal to the noise, to become one node among the thousands in the vast living circuit that is Mycorrha. </p>
    <p class="note-title">You cannot arrive at Mycorrha alone– and once you have arrived, you cannot remain alone. The city will not allow it. Not through force, but through the simple truth at isolation, here, is just another word for death. To be in Mycorrha is to be part of Mycorrha. </p>

    <p class="note-text"> To be part of Mycorrha is to be fed by others and to feed others, to be known and to know, to give up the sovereignty of the separate self and receive in return something the city has no word for except <i> life </i>, or <i>we</i>, or <i>home</i>. </p>
