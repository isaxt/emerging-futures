    <h1>ₓ˚. ୭ ˚○◦˚a note on the project˚◦○˚ ୧ .˚ₓ</h1>
    <h3>
        This project emerges from my own entangled relationship
         with religion and technology. I was not raised religious, 
         but my parents grew up Catholic and Buddhist, respectively, 
         so from a young age I was taught to respect religion. I grew
          up in the Bay Area, and I watched aspects of Silicon Valley
           transform around me. As I've gotten older and been exposed 
           to tech and startup circles, I've become fascinated by how
            these worlds intersect, clash, and merge in unexpected ways.
    </h3>
    <h3>
        I'm interested in questions that don't necessarily have easy 
           answers: What does it mean to "push the limits" of god through
            bioengineering and genetic modification? Why are younger tech 
            workers increasingly turning to their workplaces for the community 
            and spiritual guidance traditionally found in religious 
            institutions? How do we make sense of companies incorporating 
            meditation rooms and mindfulness practices into their workflows—is 
            this genuine spirituality or corporate co-option?
    </h3>

    <h3>
        The internet was supposed to kill religion. Access to information
        would dissolve faith. That didn't happen. Instead, we're seeing 
        something more complex unfold.
    </h3>

    <h3>
        This project is NOT supposed to be a singular vision of how
        religion and technology should coexist, or a prescription 
        for what this future must look like.
    </h3>

    <h3>
        Instead, it is an exploration of multiple, sometimes contradictory
             visions for how we might navigate these intersections. I've 
             deliberately researched and collected diverse perspectives—because
              I don't believe any one person, including myself, has the "right" 
              answer to these questions. This is an amalgamation, a constellation 
              of possibilities rather than a manifesto.

        <b>Consider this an invitation to sit with complexity 
              rather than a roadmap to resolution.</b>
